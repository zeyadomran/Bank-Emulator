## Zarna Bank
We plan to create an application that simulates online banking. Features include the transfer of virtual money between users, messaging, as well as a virtual deposit and withdrawal system.
Users are able to deposit, withdraw, transfer money, and send message to other users. Users can also view their transaction history and edit their information.
##### How To Launch The Program:
1. Download the latest [version](https://github.com/zeyadomran/Zarna-Bank/blob/master/Zarna%20Bank.jar).
2. Use this command in Terminal: **java -jar 'Path to file here'**
